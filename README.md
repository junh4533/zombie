##### Project Purpose
________

The purpose of this project is to see how far we could get and also to put all our knowledge into  our projects.
This project is ment for practice collaboration and linking files.
By collaboration I mean practicing with our partners  and by giving each others parts of the projects to work on.
The liking files  is in between easy in hard because you have to know what folder you want to send the link too.
